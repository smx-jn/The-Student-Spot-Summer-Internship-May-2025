# Task 1 - BFS and DFS Search Algorithms

## 🔍 Overview
This task implements two fundamental graph traversal algorithms:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Graph represented as an adjacency list
- BFS uses a queue (FIFO)
- DFS uses recursion (can also be implemented using a stack)

## 📁 File Structure
- `bfs_dfs.py`: Contains the graph and both traversal algorithms.
